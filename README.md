# Strapi Generic Backend

This is a template for a user configurable website (similar to wordpress) with a remote headless CMS (Content Management System). It uses a Postgres database to store the conetnt which will be served to a front end over an API.

In this CMS, there is an 'admin panel' that allows users to drag and drop components and build 'content structures' to apply to any domain ( restaurant reviews, blog posts, etc)



Notes: Configuration
    - A '.env' file will need to be created to store (Fake):
        HOST=X.X.X.X
        PORT=1337
        APP_KEYS=c/HjKqA6XXXXXvrIpFk6Q==,jbeO4SlLlxXXXXXsaTTA==,XXXXXxJBBT62XtChx0ipA==,SXXXxC9QUFFMI/BVncwMQ==
        API_TOKEN_SALT=bGiDDGHHd6YleaPsI4z+Q==
        ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=VDGBCXv8WmRj1vlRUoGQ5A==
        JWT_SECRET=yQql2JDDDsVeR+Dz0ZfA==
